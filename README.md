# **Phishing Website Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques**

## **Objective**

Phishing websites are a common social engineering tactic that mimic trustworthy URLs and webpages to deceive users. This project aims to train machine learning models and deep neural networks on a curated dataset to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and legitimate URLs are gathered to create the dataset, from which essential URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance of various models is measured and compared to determine the most effective approach.

## **Data Collection**

### **Phishing URLs**:
- Collected from the open-source service **PhishTank**.
  - PhishTank provides regularly updated phishing URL datasets in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, etc.).
  - Download the data: [PhishTank Developer Info](https://www.phishtank.com/developer_info.php)
  - **Sample Size**: 5,000 random phishing URLs.

### **Legitimate URLs**:
- Sourced from the **University of New Brunswick‚Äôs open datasets**.
  - The dataset contains benign, spam, phishing, malware, and defacement URLs.
  - For this project, only **benign URLs** are used.
  - Download the data: [UNB URL Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html)
  - **Sample Size**: 5,000 random legitimate URLs.

## **Feature Extraction**

Seventeen features are extracted from the dataset across three categories:

1. **Address Bar-Based Features**  
   - **9 features** extracted, including checks for URL length, the presence of special characters, and HTTPS usage.

2. **Domain-Based Features**  
   - **4 features** extracted, focusing on domain age, DNS record status, and subdomain counts.

3. **HTML & JavaScript-Based Features**  
   - **4 features** extracted, analyzing scripts, iframe usage, and suspicious tags.

The combined 10,000 URLs and extracted features are stored in the file.

Features were referenced from the [UCI Phishing Websites Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Phishing+Websites).

## **Models & Training**

The dataset is split into **80% training data (8,000 samples)** and **20% testing data (2,000 samples)**. This is a **binary classification problem**, where each URL is classified as:
- **Phishing (1)**  
- **Legitimate (0)**  

The following supervised machine learning models were used for training:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Multilayer Perceptrons**
- **XGBoost**
- **Autoencoder Neural Network**
- **Support Vector Machines**

Each model‚Äôs performance was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## **Next Steps**

### Future Enhancements:
- **Browser Extension**:
  - A browser extension will be developed to predict the nature of URLs (legitimate or phishing) in real-time.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - A GUI will allow users to input URLs for prediction and visualize results.

*Progress updates on these features will be shared in future project releases.*
